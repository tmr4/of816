; This file should define any equates that are platform specific, and may be used to
; define the system interface functions if it is not supplied elsewhere.
;
; Generally the system interface is used for console I/O
; and other such things.  The function code is given in the A register, the Y register
; has the Forth stack depth, and X is the Forth stack pointer vs the direct page.
; THE X REGISTER MUST REFLECT PROPER FORTH STACK POINTER UPON RETURN!
;
; The interface function is called with the Forth direct page and return stack in effect.
; Function codes $0000-$7FFF are reserved to be defined for use by Forth.  Codes $8000-
; $FFFF may be used by the system implementator for system-specific functions.
;
; The system interface must implement functions marked as mandatory.
; System interface functions shall RTL with the expected stack effects, AY=0, and
; carry clear if successful; or shall RTL with a code for THROW in AY and carry set on
; failure.  A safe throw code for console I/O is -21 (unsupported operation).
;
; Stack cells are 2 words/4 bytes/32 bits, and the stack pointer points to the top of
; the stack.  If the system interface is defined here, the stack manipulation functions
; defined in interpreter.s may be used.  If defined elsewhere, you are on your own for
; ensuring correct operation on the stack.
;
; The system interface functions may use the direct page ZR bytes $00-$03, if they need
; more than that they can use something reserved elsewhere via long addressing or 
; by temporarily changing the direct page.
;
; Here are the function codes, expected stack results, and descriptions
;
; $0000 ( -- ) pre initialize platform - called before Forth initialization, to be used
;       for initialization that must take place before Forth initialization.
; $0001 ( -- ) post initialize platform - called after Forth initialization, to be used
;       for initialization that must take place after Forth initialization.
; $0002 ( char -- ) emit a character to the console output.  This function should
;       implement the control sequences described in IEEE 1275-1994 (a subset of the
;       ANSI terminal standard).  For serial devices, this may be assumed.
; $0003 ( -- f ) f is true if the console input has a character waiting
; $0004 ( -- char ) read a character from the console (blocking)
; $0005 ( -- addr ) return pointer to list of FCode modules to evaluate.  If pointer is
;       0, none are evaluated.  List should be 32-bit pointers ending in 0.
;       this is never called if FCode support is not included.
;       The system will trust that there is FCode there and not look for a signature.
; $0006 ( -- ) perform RESET-ALL, restart the system as if reset button was pushed
